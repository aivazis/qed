# <a name="archives" />Connecting to data archives

Any time during a `qed` session you can connect to additional data archives. Clicking on the
<Badge><Pin/></Badge> icon will take you back to the data explorer screen:

The <Badge><Plus/></Badge> icon on the activity panel title brings up the archive connection form:

<Screenshot src="/figures/qed-archives-connect.png" />

Currently `qed` has support for accessing data either on your **local** machine, or in **s3*
buckets.

### <a name="#archives.local" />Local archives

Selecting a `local` archive brings up the following form:

<Screenshot src="/figures/qed-archives-local.png" />

The archive **nickname** should be something that is meaningful to you that is unique to this
location. The path should be the absolute path of the target directory on your machine.

Clicking the **connect** will mount the new archive and display its contents in a collapsible tray,
with subdirectories at the top and regular files at the bottom. Directories can be expanded by
clicking on them; clicking on files will bring up the dataset connection form that we saw in the
section on loading datasets.

### <a name="#archives.s3" />Amazon S3

Selecting **s3** as the archive type brings up the S3 specific connector:

<Screenshot src="/figures/qed-archives-s3.png" />

The only required field is the archive **nickname**. The rest of the fields may or may not be
required, depending on the actual access mode and authentication mechanisms in place for accessing
your S3 buckets. Contact your local S3 administrator if you need help getting access.

After filling out the form and clicking **connect**, you will get a hierarchical listing of the
specified bucket, very similar to what local archives produce. Please remember that the types of
data products `qed` can access remotely may be more limited. As of this writing, only HDF5 and GDAL
readable files are supported.
