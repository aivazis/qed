## Two

Drilling down into the details of capability. This is a long description with enough text  to make

### Three

A small corner with details that could be skipped on first reading. Let's continue describing what

Another small corner with details that could be skipped on first reading. Let's continue describing

One more small corner with details that could be skipped on first reading. Let's continue describing
what might go here, until there is enough text to fill the pane.

And a final small corner with details that could be skipped on first reading. Let's continue

Here is some helpful code

``` python
def foo(arg, **kwds):
    """
    This is the docstring for this function
    """
    # show me
    print(f"arg: {arg}")
    # all done
    return
```
