# <a name="intro"></a>Getting started

If you are reading this from within `qed`, you should be able to skip to the launching instructions
at the end of this section.

Similarly, if you are lucky enough to work on a machine that is managed professionally, `qed` may
already be installed. Please contact the system administrators for instructions about how to access
it, and skip to the end of this section.

If you are comfortable with `jupyter` notebooks, the current
[release tarball](https://github.com/aivazis/qed/archive/refs/tags/v0.9.3.tar.gz)
contains a notebook that can walk you through the installation procedure with minimal tweaking.
It is located in `etc/mamba/qed.ipynb`. Please report any difficulties you encounter.

The same tarball has instructions on how to build a `docker` instance with a `qed` installation.
You will find support for many recent `ubuntu` distributions in `etc/docker/dev`.

If none of these options work for you, read on to the next section for a walk through of how to
build `qed` from source.

### <a name="dependencies"></a>Dependencies

The easiest way to install the `qed` dependencies is using `micromamba` and `conda-forge`. The
following configuration file will install everything `qed` needs in an environment named `qed`. Feel
free to add these packages to an existing environment, rather than building one from scratch,
although it might be easier at first if you avoid any potential conflicts with your existing
environment.

``` yaml
# -*- yaml -*-

name: qed

channels:
  - conda-forge

dependencies:
  - python
  - git
  - gcc
  - gxx
  - gfortran
  - make
  - nodejs
  - awscli
  - gsl
  - hdf5
  - openssl
  - boto3
  - graphene
  - numpy
  - pybind11
  - pytest
  - ruamel.yaml
  - yaml

# end of file
```

On `macOS`, you may want to use `clang` instead of `gcc`. Make sure you activate this environment
before moving on to build `qed`.

It is also possible to use other package managers to install these dependencies. Both `pyre` and
`qed` have been tested on both `ubuntu` and `macOS` using their native environments, `macports`,
`homebrew`, `spack`. Please keep in mind that most enterprise systems provide compilers and packages
that are too old to build this code, so you will have to lean on something else to satisfy the
dependencies. Further, you may have to adjust your `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, and
perhaps other environment variables that control access to binaries, shared objects, and `python`
packages on your machine.

### <a name="cloning"></a>Cloning the repositories

We will need a place to clone the necessary source repositories. For the sake of concreteness, let's
pick `~/dv` as the source directory.

``` bash
~> mkdir dv
~> cd dv
```

GitHub allows access through `ssh` or `https`, with slightly different syntax. If you already have
your `ssh` key installed on your GitHub account, you can clone the three repositories using

``` bash
~/dv> git clone git@github.com:aivazis/mm
~/dv> git clone git@github.com:pyre/pyre
~/dv> git clone git@github.com:aivazis/qed
```

Alternatively, you can use the `https` protocol for anonymous access:

``` bash
~> mkdir dv
~> cd dv
~/dv> git clone https://github.com/aivazis/mm
~/dv> git clone https://github.com/pyre/pyre
~/dv> git clone https://github.com/aivazis/qed
```

You can probably get away with installing `pyre` from `conda-forge`, but `qed` and `pyre` are
currently evolving together rather quickly. Being tied to a slower release cycle may delay access to
the latest feadtures. Generally speaking, the `HEAD` of all three repositories is a safe place to
pull from, as they are thoroughly tested.

### <a name="mm"></a>Setting up the build system

The most involved step of the installation process is the configuration of the build system.
We will place configuration files in two locations:

``` bash
~/dv> cd ~
~> mkdir -p .config/pyre
~> mkdir -p .config/mm
```

The conifguration for the build system lives in `~/.config/pyre/mm.yaml`:
``` yaml
# -*- yaml -*-

# mm configuration
mm:

  # targets
  target: "opt, shared"

  # compilers
  compilers: "gcc, python/python3"

  # the following two settings get replaced with actual values by the notebook
  # the location of final products
  prefix: "{pyre.environ.CONDA_PREFIX}"
  # the installation location of the python packages, relative to {prefix}
  pycPrefix: "lib/python3.12/site-packages"
  # the location of the temporary intermediate build products
  bldroot: "{pyre.environ.HOME}/tmp/builds/mm/{pyre.environ.CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV}"

  # misc
  # the name of GNU make
  make: make
  # local makefiles
  local: Make.mmm

# end of file
```

You may need to replace `gcc` and the `python` version with whatever is available in your
environment. Incidentally, the directory `~/.config/pyre` is the home for configuration files for
all `pyre` applications, including `qed`, so we will be adding more files here later on.

The build system needs to know where to find headers and libraries for the `qed` dependencies. The
package database lives in `~/.config/mm/config.mm`:

``` makefile
# -*- Makefile -*-

# external dependencies
# system tools
sys.prefix := ${CONDA_PREFIX}

# gsl
gsl.version := 2.7
gsl.dir := $(sys.prefix)

# hdf5
hdf5.version := 1.15.0
hdf5.dir := ${sys.prefix}
hdf5.parallel := off

# libpq
libpq.version := 16.1
libpq.dir := ${sys.prefix}

# pybind11
pybind11.version := 2.11.1
pybind11.dir = $(sys.prefix)

# python: just major.minor
python.version := 3.12
python.dir := $(sys.prefix)

# numpy
numpy.version := 1.26.3
numpy.dir := $(sys.prefix)/lib/python$(python.version)/site-packages/numpy/core

# pyre
pyre.version := 1.12.4
pyre.dir := $(sys.prefix)

# end of file
```

Most of the indicated package versions are there for documentation purposes, with the exception
of the `python` version that is used by `mm` to find the various locations where the interpreter
and its packages deposit fiels it needs.

### <a name="building"></a>Building

The next step is to build `pyre` and `qed`. We will invoke `mm` a few times, so you may find
it convenient to create an alias for it.

``` bash
~/dv> alias mm='python3 ${HOME}/dv/mm/mm'
```

You might want to make this more permanent by also adding it to your shell startup file, e.g. your
`~/.bash_profile`.

Let's verify that everything is ok so far. Let's go to the `pyre` source directory and ask `mm` to
show details about the build. This should generate a few lines of output similar to the
following:

``` bash
~/dv> cd pyre
~/dv/pyre> mm builder.info

    mm 5.0.0

builder directory layout:
  staging layout:
           tmp = /Users/mga/tmp/builds/mm/clang/opt-shared-darwin-arm64/
  install layout:
        prefix = /Users/mga/.local/envs/qed
           bin = /Users/mga/.local/envs/qed/bin/
           doc = /Users/mga/.local/envs/qed/doc/
           inc = /Users/mga/.local/envs/qed/include/
           lib = /Users/mga/.local/envs/qed/lib/
         share = /Users/mga/.local/envs/qed/share/
           pyc = /Users/mga/.local/envs/qed/lib/python3.12/site-packages/
~/dv/pyre>
```

You may see `mm` download a `pyre` archive from `github` to bootstrap the process. This is normal,
as `mm` is itself a `pyre` application.

If anything goes wrong at this stage that cannot be resolved by retracing your steps looking for
typos, please file an [issue](https://github.com/aivazis/qed/issues) at the `qed` repository,
and attach a log file or a screenshot to help diagnose the problem.

If everything looks ok, let's build and install `pyre`. If you are on a `linux` system, `mm` will
automatically discover the number of cores on your machine and launch a parallel build:

``` bash
~/dv/pyre> mm
```

On `macOS`, it needs some help until `pyre` is built, so use something like:

``` bash
~/dv/pyre> mm --slots=20
```

Don't worry if you don't have twenty cores on your machine. Most modern machines will be able to
handle this load. Feel free to up the count if you are on a machine with more cores. If all goes
well, you will have a functional `pyre` in the `site-packages` directory of your `python`
installation. Let's verify:

``` bash
~/dv/pyre> python3
>>> import pyre
>>> pyre.__file__
```

Both statements should succeed, and the latter should print out the `pyre` installation location.

Similarly for `qed`:

``` bash
~/dv/pyre> cd ../qed
~/dv/qed> mm builder.info
~/dv/qed> mm
```

Again, if anything goes wrong, please reach out, and include as much about the failure as you
can gather.


### <a name="launching"></a>Launching

If you are installing in a `conda` environment, `mm` deposits `qed` in a directory that is already
on your path so there are no additional steps to take to make it accessible. If not, you will have to
tweak your environment variables.

By default, the application operates as a command line tool:

``` bash
~/dv/qed> qed

  qed 0.9.3 revision 038a584

         --shell: my hosting strategy [pyre.shells]
         --DEBUG: debugging mode [bool]
```

Launching it in the browser requires a couple of command line arguments

``` bash
~/dv/qed> qed --shell=web --shell.auto=yes
qed: web server on '0.0.0.0':51122
```

This shows that the `qed` web server has started and is listening for connections at a specific
port. The option `--shell.auto=yes` instructs `qed` to start a broswer automatically and point it
to this port. You can make this behavior the default by creating a configuration file. Settings that
affect all invokations of `qed` should be placed in a configuration file at
`~/.config/pyre/qed.yaml`

``` yaml
# -*- yaml -*-

shell: web
shell.auto: yes

# end of file
```

Settings from a `qed.yaml` in the current working directory override these global defaults, so you
have complete control over how the application behaves by creating local configuration files next
to your data. More details about application configuration, both from the command line and from
within configuration files can be found in the section on [configuring](#mm) the app.

Let's get some data to play with. NISAR has a publicly accessible
[site](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/data/sample-data/) with examples of all the planned standard data
products in `hdf5` format. In the next section you will see how to read these products, select among
the datasets they contain, and control the various visualization aspects. The filenames on the site
are rather long, so in what follows they have been renamed to match their product type. Let's make a
directory to house them, and download as many of them as you would like.

``` bash
~/dv/qed> cd ..
~/dv> mkdir -p data/nisar
~/dv> cd data/nisar
~/dv/data/nisar>
```

You are now ready to move on to the next section that will walk through the various application
features.
