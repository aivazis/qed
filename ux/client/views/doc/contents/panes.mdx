# <a name="panes" />Working with multiple data panes

Let's go back to the data explorer, connect the readers for the RIFG and RUNW sample datasets, and
dismiss all the others. Select the `phase` channel of the `rifg` dataset, making the browser window
look something like this:

### <a name="#panes.scroll" />Synchronized scrolling

Clicking on the <Badge><Split/></Badge> icon of the data pane will split it in two, and make the new
pane the active one. You can always tell which pane is the active one from its highlighted title
bar. Similarly, you can tell which dataset and channel are being displayed in the active data pane
because the corresponding readers and its selectors will be highlighted in the dataset activity
pane.

Each data pane is now entirely independent. You can select either as the active one by clicking
anywhere in its client area, and you can modify what is being displayed by picking whichever channel
you would like to display in each one. Let's click on the `unwrapped` channel of `runw` to place its
image in the active pane, yielding a screen that looks something like this:

<Screenshot src="/figures/qed-panes-two.png" />

You can click on the <Badge><gear/></Badge> icon on the activity bar and make any modifications you
like to the view in the active data pane.

The two datasets on display in our example are actually related: they are both interferograms in
radar coordinates, the only difference being whether the phase is unwrapped or not. You can sync the
scrolling of the two data panes so that you can look at the same area in both panes side by side by
clicking on the <Badge><Eye/></Badge> icon on the two title bars until both are on. Any scrolling on
either pane will now change both so that the pixel locations of the upper left hand corners of the
two panes are identical, if possible.

The same procedure will work regardless of how many times you have split teh data panes. Each one
can opt in to synchronized scrolling by toggling its <Badge><Eye/></Badge>. You can toggle all
panes at the same time by Alt/option clicking on the icon.

### <a name="#panes.scroll" />The sync table

It is occasionally useful to make other synchronized changes to data pane contents. The control
activity panel has a **sync** tray at the bottom that offers more options.

<Screenshot src="/figures/qed-panes-table.png" />

As you can see, the `scroll` column is on for both of our panes, reflecting the fact that we have
synchronized their scrolling. You can control which panes have opted in to synchronized scrolling
by toggling their entries in this table. Clicking on the `scroll` column header toggles all the
panes at once, just like the Alt/option click on the sync icon on the data pane title.

This table offers one refinement that is useful occasionally: you can specify a set of relative
**offsets** to apply while scrolling the synced datasets.

Similarly, you can synchronize **zoom** level changes, and even **path** specifications, down to the
level of which points are selected, and how points are moved. Every change is simply mirrored by all
data panes that have opted in. Finally, if both datasets offer the same **channel** selection, you
can sync the channel selection.
