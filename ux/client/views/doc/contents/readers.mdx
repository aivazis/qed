# <a name="readers" />Loading datasets

In the section on <Link to="intro#launching">launching</Link> the `qed` server, we installed a
global configuration file in `~/.config/pyre/qed.yaml` that starts the web server and
automatically opens a new browser window with a connection to the server:

``` yaml
# -*- yaml -*-

# launch the web server
shell: web
# connect a new browser window/tab to the qed server automatically
shell.auto: yes

# end of file
```

We also created a directory `~/dv/data/nisar-samples` and populated it with the NISAR standard data
products from the project [website](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/data/sample-data/). We also renamed
the samples according to their product type, to reduce clutter. The directory should look something
like this:

``` bash
~/dv/data/nisar-samples> ls -lh
total 2.7G
-rw-r--r-- 1 mga staff 243M Jan 14 17:24 gcov.h5
-rw-r--r-- 1 mga staff 209M Jan 14 17:24 goff.h5
-rw-r--r-- 1 mga staff 651M Jan 14 17:29 gslc.h5
-rw-r--r-- 1 mga staff 465M Jan 14 08:36 gunw.h5

-rw-r--r-- 1 mga staff  48M Jan 14 08:35 runw.h5
```

With these settings, launching `qed` from the terminal should open a browser window that looks
something like this:

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-archives-empty.png" width="100%" />

The column of icons on the left, the **activity bar**, is the main navigational element. It is
followed by the **activity pane** whose contents are specific to selected activity. In this case,
the current activity is the archive explorer, indicated by the highlight next to the activity icon.
Our activity pane is titled "DATA ARCHIVES" and displays the contents of the default archive, i.e.
the directory from which we launched the server at the terminal.

The activity pane contains a single archive named `local:workspace`. The visibility of its contents
can be toggled by clicking on the <Badge><Chevron /></Badge> next to its name. The contents show the
URL of the archive, followed by a listing of the available files. Connected archives can be
dismissed by clicking on the <Badge><X /></Badge> on their title bar.

The activity pane is followed by one or more **data panes** that comprise the main work area of the
application. When empty, the data panes typically display the icon that corresponds to the currently
selected activity. Unless configured otherwise, `qed` starts up with a single empty data pane. You
can split a data pane in two by clicking on the <Badge><Split /></Badge> icon on its title bar, and
you can dismiss it by clicking on <Badge><X /></Badge>.

Terminating a `qed` session requires two separate steps: stopping the `qed` server, and dismissing
the browser window. The latter can only be done by the user, as there is no browser independent way
to close a tab or window programmatically. The former requires sending a signal to the server to
stop it. If you have access to the terminal from which the server was launched, you can use whatever
process control facilities are available in your shell. For example, if the server is the foreground
process, you can type `ctrl-C` to shut it down gracefully and terminate its process. An alternative
is to click in the <Badge><Skull /></Badge> icon on the activity bar to send a signal to the server.
In *ad hoc* installations of `qed`, this will terminate the server, but it is possible that your
system administrator has set up something more complex surrounding the termination of the `qed`
server. On the NISAR on-demand system, for example, a daemon is watching the `qed` server process
and re-spawns it when it terminates with a signal. In such installations, you can treat the
<Badge><Skull/></Badge> icon as a reboot of the server.

### <a name="#readers.nisar" />Connecting a NISAR reader

Selecting `gunw.h5` from the listing of the archive contents brings up the reader connection form.

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-nisar-entry.png" width="100%" />

The sequence of steps necessary to successfully connect a `qed` reader depend on the data source.
Each reader provides specialized support for the internal structure of the data product and the
encoding of its pixels, the availability of the metadata required to map the signal in each product
to colored pixels on the screen, as well as specialized visualizations particular to each product
type. At the top level, `qed` provides support for NISAR data products, partial support for the data
formats understood by the popular `isce2` SAR processor, partial integration with `gdal` to access
the many data formats it supports, and access to flat binary files on local disk. The main focus of
the development effort so far has been support for the NISAR level 1 and level 2 products, but
support for the other types, especially `isce2` and `gdal`, is an on-going effort. Furthermore,
`qed` is designed to be extensible, so there is a path for integrating support for custom formats
by the end user.

NISAR datasets are stored in HDF5 files and are fully self-describing. Typically, this means that
there is very little guesswork associated with connecting them to `qed`, which knows the layout of
all level 1 and level 2 NISAR data products. Clicking on `nisar` instructs `qed` to open the file
with the reader that is able to determine the product details automatically:

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-nisar-product.png" width="100%" />

Note that `qed` recognized that `gunw.h5` is an unwrapped interferogram and selected the appropriate
product type automatically. The `connect` button is not yet active because `qed` is still expecting
one more piece of information: the **nickname** of this data product. The nickname is a user
specified string that gets associated with this dataset for the remainder of your `qed` session. If
you use any of the `qed` persistence features to save your choices for how to visualize this
dataset, they will be recorded in a dictionary using the nickname as the retrieval key. The current
version of `qed` does not attempt to provide any suggestions about how to name your datasets, so you
will have to choose one on your own. Picking the, admittedly unimaginative, `gunw` nickname for our
dataset yields:

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-nisar-nickname.png" width="100%" />

Note that the `connect` and `cancel` buttons are now active, indicating that `qed` has enough
information to connect this reader to the app so we can start visualizing its contents. Clicking
on `connect` adds the reader to data pile and returns the screen to its original form.

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-archives-empty.png" width="100%" />

At this point you can choose to connect more datasets, or proceed to explore the ones
that are already connected by clicking on the <Badge><Data /></Badge> on the activity bar.

### <a name="#readers.flat" />Loading flat binary files

The NISAR standard products require very little user intervention because of the wealth of metadata
stored in HDF5 files. At the other extreme are flat binary files that require the user to provide
the dataset shape and its data type before they can be properly registered.

If you are following along with this guide and you don't have easy access to data to play with, you
can ask `qed` to generate a couple of samples:

``` bash
~/dv/data/nisar-samples> cd ../../qed/data/native
~/dv/qed/data/native> ls -lh
total 8.0K
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mga staff 2.0K Apr 27 20:41 d16.cc
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mga staff 2.0K Apr 27 20:41 d8.cc
~/dv/qed/data/native> mm data
  [c++] data/native/d16.cc
  [test] native/d16
  [c++] data/native/d8.cc
  [test] native/d8
~/dv/qed/data/native> ls -lh
total 529M
-rwxrwxr-x 1 mga staff  39K Apr 27 21:27 d16
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mga staff 2.0K Apr 27 20:41 d16.cc
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mga staff  83K Apr 27 21:27 d16.d
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mga staff 363M Apr 27 21:27 d16.dat
-rwxrwxr-x 1 mga staff  39K Apr 27 21:27 d8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mga staff 2.0K Apr 27 20:41 d8.cc
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mga staff  83K Apr 27 21:27 d8.d
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mga staff 182M Apr 27 21:27 d8.dat
~/dv/qed/data/native>
```

The two files `d16.dat` and `d18.dat` are flat binary files with `std::complex<double>` and
`std::complex<float>` pixels, respectively, and are plots of `(z-1)/(z^2 + z + 1)`. Assuming that
you still have the `qed.yaml` file that we placed in `~/.config/pyre`, launching `qed` from this
location yields

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-flat-empty.png" width="100%" />

Let's click on the `d16.dat` entry in the archive listings. This brings up the reader selection form

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-flat-entry.png" width="100%" />

Clicking on `native` deploys the reader that specializes on flat binary files

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-flat-product.png" width="100%" />

The next thing we have to provide is the dataset nickname:

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-flat-nickname.png" width="100%" />

The `d16` dataset has `std::complex<double>` pixels, which correspond to the `complex128` cell
selection

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-flat-cell.png" width="100%" />

This leaves us with having to specify the image shape. With a known pixel type and file size, `qed`
provides some shape guidance by generating plausible pairs. In order to keep the choices to a
manageable level, you can constrain the image aspect ratio. You can specify the shape by either
selecting one of the available choices or supplying the number of lines and samples in directly in
the form. For each selection, `qed` generates an image preview to help decide whether the chosen
shape make sense. Our sample image is `3929 x 6049`, so selecting this shape from the list yields

<Screenshot src="figures/qed-flat-shape.png" width="100%" />

with the preview clearly showing the location of the two poles in the dataset. At this point you can
choose to connect more datasets, or proceed to explore the ones that are already connected by
clicking on the <Badge><Data /></Badge> icon on the activity bar.

### <a name="#readers.isce2" />Support for `isce2`

There is an ongoing effort to provide support for all input, intermediate, and output data products
from [`isce2`]() workflows. These data products are flat binary files, so in principle they can be
read using the machinery described in the previous section. However, native support offers several
advantages:

* `isce2` workflows generate auxiliary files that contain product metadata, such as product
  type, pixel type, shape, etc.

* Certain data products, such as wrapped and unwrapped interferograms, have custom visualization
  pipelines that include specialized color maps that are in wide use in the community.

Reader selection is very streamlined when the auxiliary files are present, and most of the
associated form is prefilled with values from the metadata file. If the auxiliary file is missing,
the specification workflow is very similar to the one shown in the previous section.

### <a name="#readers.gdal" />Using `gdal`

It is possible, although currently not well supported, to use `gdal` as the data product reader.
This is useful for opening data products in any of the myriad of formats supported by it. This
effort is on-going and updates are forthcoming. Stay tuned.
