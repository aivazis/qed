# <a name="readers" />Loading datasets

In the section on <Link to="intro#launching">launching</Link> the `qed` server, we installed a
global configuration file in `~/.config/pyre/qed.yaml` that starts the web server and
automatically opens a new borwser window with a connection to the server:

``` yaml
# -*- yaml -*-

# launch the web server
shell: web
# connect a new browser window/tab to the qed server automatically
shell.auto: yes

# end of file
```

We also created a directory `~/dv/data/nisar-samples` and populated it with the NISAR standard data
products from the project [website](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/data/sample-data/). We also renamed
the samples according to their product type, to reduce clutter. The directory should look something
like this:

``` bash
~/dv/data/nisar-samples> ls -lh
total 2.7G
-rw-r--r-- 1 mga staff 243M Jan 14 17:24 gcov.h5
-rw-r--r-- 1 mga staff 209M Jan 14 17:24 goff.h5
-rw-r--r-- 1 mga staff 651M Jan 14 17:29 gslc.h5

```

With these settings, launching `qed` from the terminal should open a browser window that looks
something like this:

<Screenshot src="/figures/qed-archives-empty.png" width="100%" />

The column of icons on the left, the **activity bar**, is the main navigational element. It is
followed by the **activity pane** whose contents are specific to selected activity. In this case,
the current activity is the archive explorer, indicated by the highlight next to the activity icon.
Our activity pane is titled "DATA ARCHIVES" and displays the contents of the default archive, i.e.
the directory from which we launched the server at the terminal.

The activity pane contains only one archive named `local:workspace`. The visibility of its contents
can be toggled by clicking on the <Badge><Chevron /></Badge> next to its name. The contents show the
URL of the archive, followed by a listing of the available files. Connected archives can be
dismissed by clicking on the <Badge><X /></Badge> on their title bar.

The activity pane is followed by one or more **data panes** that comprise the main work area of the
application. When empty, the data panes typically display the icon that corresponds to the currently
selected activity. Unless configured outherwise, `qed` starts up with a single empty data pane. You
can split a data pane in two by clicking on the <Badge><Split /></Badge> icon on its title bar, and
you can dismiss it by clicking on <Badge><X /></Badge>.

### <a name="#readers.nisar" />Connecting a NISAR reader

Selecting `gunw.h5` from the listing of the archive contents brings up the reader connection form.

The sequence of steps necessary to successfully connect a `qed` reader depend on the data source.
NISAR datasets are stored in HDF5 files and are fully self-describing. Typically, this means that
there is very little guesswork associated with connecting them to `qed`, which knows the layout of
all Level 1 and Level 2 NISAR data products. Clicking on `nisar` instructs `qed` to open the file
with the reader that is able to determine the product details automatically:

<Screenshot src="/figures/qed-readers-product.png" width="100%" />

Note that `qed` recognized that `gunw.h5` is an unwrapped interferogram and selected the appropriate
product type automatically. The `connect` button is not yet active because `qed` is still expecting
one more piece of information: the **nickname** of this data product. The nickname is a user
specified string that gets associated with this dataset for the remainder of your `qed` session. If
you use any of the `qed` persistence features to save your choices for how to visualizae this
dataset, they will be recorded in a dictionary using the nickname as the retrieval key. The current
version of `qed` does not attempt to provide any suggestions about how to name your datasets, so
you will to choose one on your own. Picking the, admittedly unimaginative, `gunw` nickname for our
dataset yields:

<Screenshot src="/figures/qed-readers-nickname.png" width="100%" />

Note that the `connect` and `cancel` buttons are now active, indicating that `qed` has enough
information to connect this reader to the app so we can start visualizing its contents. Clicking
on `connect` adds the reader to data pile and returns the screen to its original form.

At this point you can choose to connect more DataTransferItemList, or proceed to explore the ones
that are already connected.
