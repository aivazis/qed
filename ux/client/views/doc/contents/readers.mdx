In the section on <Link to="intro#launching">launching</Link> the `qed` server, we installed a
global configuration file in `~/.config/pyre/qed.yaml` that starts the web server and
automatically opens a new borwser window with a connection to the server:

``` yaml
# -*- yaml -*-

# launch the web server
shell: web
# connect a new browser window/tab to the qed server automatically
shell.auto: yes

# end of file
```

We also created a directory `~/dv/data/nisar-samples` and populated it with the NISAR standard data
products from the project [website](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/data/sample-data/). We also renamed
the samples according to their product type, to reduce clutter. The directory should look something
like this:

``` bash
~/dv/data/nisar-samples> ls -lh
total 2.7G

```

With these settings, launching `qed` from the terminal should open a browser window that looks
something like this:

<Screenshot src="/figures/qed-archives-empty.png" width="100%" />

The column of icons on the left, the **activity bar**, is the main navigational element. It is
followed by the **activity pane** whose contents are specific to selected activity. In this case,
the current activity is the archive explorer, indicated by the highlight next to the activity icon.
Our activity pane is titled "DATA ARCHIVES" and displays the contents of the default archive, i.e.
the directory from which we launched the server at the terminal.

The activity pane is followed by one or more **data panes** that comprise the main work area of the
application. When empty, the data panes typically display the icon that corresponds to the currently
selected activity. We only have a single empty data pane. You can split a data pane in two by
clicking on the <Badge><Split /></Badge> icon on its title bar, and you can dismiss it by clicking
on <Badge><X /></Badge>.
